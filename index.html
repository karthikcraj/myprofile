        <p> The main objective of this project is to reduce human workload and human error.This robot will pick a object from a particular place and place it manually in desired place by using android app.The key feature of this project is that,also using the "save button" in the app,we can record each postion of robot arm and then robot can automatically run and repeat these movement.With the same "save button",we can pause repeated operation as well as reset or delete all recorded movement and then record new movements. </p>

        <p>Our main goal in this project was to construct a protection room for endangered species. Sensor technology was used to identify an
            unfavourable situation for the species, which will then be automatically changed to a favourable environment. My contribution
            to this project was to design and build the circuit.</p>

        <p>The main objective of this project is to avoid air pollution in our society which is emitted from the vehicle. The details of the vehicle
            will get using RFID Technology. The concentration of the polluted emission from the vehicle can be measure using MQ7 sensor. Whenever the emission level exceeds beyond normal value, an
            alerting message will be sent to the user mobile phone. I have donethe programming phase of the project.</p>
